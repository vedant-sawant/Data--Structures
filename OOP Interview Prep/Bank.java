/*
 Explain encapsulation and demonstrate it with a Java program. 
 Create a class called BankAccount with private fields for accountNumber, 
 accountHolderName, and balance. Provide public getter and setter methods for each 
 field to allow controlled access to these private fields. Additionally, add a 
 deposit method to increase the balance and a withdraw method to reduce the balance, 
 making sure that the withdrawal amount doesnâ€™t exceed the current balance.

// Encapsulation means hiding of data and only showing what is required.
